## Html file structure

This is the basic file structure for a html file that you'll generated by visual studio code

```html
<!-- the !DOCTYPE tells the browser that the content of the file is in html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- the html tag describes the root of a html document -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- the <head> is where site metadata is described, as well as adding scripts & style sheets -->
  <head>
    <!-- this tells the browser how to interpet the text (kinda like artist/title unicode & regular in osu) -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <!-- idk what this does -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />

    <!--this tells the bropwser -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- what the title of the browser tab will be -->
    <title>My Document</title>

    <!-- you can add style sheets like this -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

    <!-- scripts are added like this -->
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Basic syntax

A html file is made up of small blocks called elements, which describe the structure and content of the website. Elements are written in the following syntax

```html
<tag attribute="value" attribute2="another value"> content </tag>
```

`<tag>` marks the beginning of an element and `</tag>` marks the end of an element.
`tag` refers to the type of object that you want to create, and can carry special functionality.
`attributes` are used to further describe an element's behaviour and to attach additional data to it.

Elements can contain content, this can be text or other elements.

```html
<div>
  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
</div>
```

If an element contains no content, you can use this special syntax there's less typing

```html
<div attribute="value" />
```

## Common element tags

You can read up on detailed descriptions of all the tags there are under [https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)

### Div

A div descibes a division of a page, usually to apply styles to it. Layout wise it wraps its contents in a box, and by default puts the element on a new line. It's pretty much the go-to tag for everything that doesn't already have a specific tag for it.

```html
<div style="background: #444444">
  <h3>Header</h3>
  <p>Some text</p>
</div>
```

What this looks like:

<div style="max-width: 50%">
<div style="background: #444444">
    <h3>Header</h3>
    <p>Some text</p>
</div>
</div>

---

### Paragraph

```html
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```

Does pretty much what you'd expect from the name. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

---

### Heading

Adds text that is bigger and bolder than paragraphs to mark section headers.
There are 6 different levels of headers, starting at 1 as the biggest header and getting smaller until you reach level 6, which is the smallest.

```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>
```

Here's what this looks like:

<div>
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6</h6>
</div>

---

### Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks are used to navigate the user to different sites, or other sections of the current site. The `href` attribute is used to tell the browser where to navigate to when the link is clicked, while the content of the element defines what the link will look like.

```html
<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1772935"> Go look at my new map </a>
```

The link will then be rendered like this:

<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1772935">Go look at my new map</a>

You can navigate to other parts of the same page by using `#id` as url.
```html
<a href="#button">This will navigate you to the section about buttons</a>
```
<a href="#button">This will navigate you to the section about buttons</a>

### Image

The `img` tag is used to add images to a website. The `src` attribute contains a path that points to the image file that will be displayed. The `width` and `height` attributes can be used to describet he width and height of the image in pixels, if one of the two values is omitted, the browser will scale the image so the original aspect ratio is preserved. If both values are omitted, the browser will try to display the image in it's original resolution (unless changed through css).

<img src="logo.png" width="138" height="120" />

### Span

Spans are typically used to mark text changes that happen in-line (without changing the layout of the text).

```html
<p>
  This is <span style="color: red">red</span> and this is
  <span style="color: blue">blue</span>
</p>
```

<p>This is <span style="color: red">red</span> and this is <span style="color: blue">blue</span></p>

---

### Lists

There's two types of lists, `unordered lists` (`<ul>`) which create a list with bullet points, and `ordered lists`(`<ol>`) which adds a number in front of each entry of the list.
Items of the list are written as `<li>` elements.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
```

<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

```html
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>
```

<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

---

### Button

The `<button>` tag defines a clickable button.

```html
<button>Click me</button>
```

<button>Click me</button>

---

### Input

Input elements are used to let the user enter data into your website.
There are different types of inputs, which let you define what kind of data you want the user to input:

- `<input type="button">`
- `<input type="checkbox">`
- `<input type="color">`
- `<input type="date">`
- `<input type="datetime-local">`
- `<input type="email">`
- `<input type="file">`
- `<input type="hidden">`
- `<input type="image">`
- `<input type="month">`
- `<input type="number">`
- `<input type="password">`
- `<input type="radio">`
- `<input type="range">`
- `<input type="reset">`
- `<input type="search">`
- `<input type="submit">`
- `<input type="tel">`
- `<input type="text">` (default value)
- `<input type="time">`
- `<input type="url">`
- `<input type="week">`

_Note:_ The input element does not need to be closed so you can write `<input>` without having to add the closing `</input>`

### Textarea

The `<textarea>` tag defines a multi-line text input control.
You can use the `rows` and `cols` attributes to definew how many lines tall and wide the element can fit. Unlike input elements, the value is written as content of the tag, instead of the `value` attribute.

```html
<textarea rows="4" cols="50">
Text area content goes here
</textarea>
```

<textarea rows="4" cols="50">
Text area content goes here
</textarea>

### Comment

Comments do nothing, except let u explain parts of your code without affecting it's behaviour, or leaving mystery messages for people who think they need to use inspect element.

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

## Common attribute types

### ID

```html
<p id="unique-id"></p>
```

An id is used to give an element a unique name in the page so you can can e.g. add style for a single element, or to add behaviour to one.

### Class

```html
<p class="class-1 class-2"></p>
```

You can use classes to add elements to groups, or to assign elements shared behaviour / styling.

### Style
The `style` attribute accepts css to describe the style of a single element.
```html
<div style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This text is red and bold</div>
```
<div style="color: red; font-weight: bold">This text is red and bold</div>




## Html file structure

  <head>
    <!-- this tells the browser how to interpet the text (kinda like artist/title unicode & regular in osu) -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <!-- idk what this does -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />

    <!--this tells the bropwser -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- what the title of the browser tab will be -->
    <title>My Document</title>

    <!-- you can add style sheets like this -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

    <!-- scripts are added like this -->
